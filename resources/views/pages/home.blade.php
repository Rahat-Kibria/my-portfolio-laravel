            childhood in Chittagong.</p>
        <p>I spent my school and college life at Bangladesh Nou-Bahini School and College Chittagong. After
            that I went to Chittagong College to study BSc in Physics. But after a year, I left Chittagong
            College and went to International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC) to study BSc in CSE.</p>
        <p>My varsity project was to make an e-commerce website. This led me to gain my interest in Web
